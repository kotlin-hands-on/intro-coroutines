TODO: Write aggregation code.

 In the initial list each user is present several times, once for each
 repository he or she contributed to.
 Merge duplications: each user should be present only once in the resulting list
 with the total value of contributions for all the repositories.
 Users should be sorted in a descending order by their contributions.

 The corresponding test can be found in test/tasks/AggregationKtTest.kt.
 You can use 'Navigate | Test' menu action (note the shortcut) to navigate to the test.
